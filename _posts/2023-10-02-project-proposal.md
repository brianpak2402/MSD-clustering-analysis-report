The following page will contain the Project Proposal for our Music Clustering project.

## Introduction & Background

A quick introduction of your topic and mostly literature review of what has been done in this area. You can briefly explain your dataset and its features here too.

## Problem Definition

Why there is a problem here or what is the motivation of the project?

## Potential Results & Discussion

What algorithms or methods are you going to use to solve the problems. (Note: Methods may change when you start implementing them which is fine). Students are encouraged to use existing packages and libraries (i.e. scikit-learn) instead of coding the algorithms from scratch.

(The results may change while you are working on the project and it is fine; that’s why it is called research). A good way to talk about potential results is to discuss about what type of quantitative metrics your team plan to use for the project

## References

At least three references (preferably peer reviewed). You need to properly cite the references on your proposal. This part does NOT count towards word limit.

## Proposed Timeline

Add proposed timeline from start to finish and list each project members’ responsibilities.

## Contributions

A contribution table with all group members’ names that explicitly provides the contribution of each member in preparing the project task. This part does NOT count towards word limit.
